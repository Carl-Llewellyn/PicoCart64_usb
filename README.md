# PicoCart64
Nintendo 64 flash cart using a Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040. So far, all of the work happens in the `develop` branch and is highly experimental. Follow kbeckmann on [twitch](https://twitch.tv/kbeckmann) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/kbeckmann) to follow along while he's working on the project.

There are parallel projects currently:
- The _lite_ version using one Raspberry Pi Pico board capable of booting homebrew
- The _stamp_ version using one RP2040 Stamp from Solder Party. This is used as an experimental development platform for the _next-gen_ version.
- The _next-gen_ version which might have two RP2040 chips, on-board PSRAM chip supporting ROMs up to 64MB, a WiFi module and SD-card support. (This does not exist yet.)

The following concerns the _lite_ version, unless noted.

# Getting up to speed
Although PicoCart64 is still a very young project there are several people interested in contributing already. A PicoCart64-lite board is capable of loading up to 2MB ROMs on an unmodified N64 and unmodified Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Getting the raw PCB
_Note that currently this is a work-in-progress, and even the first version of the PCB has not been tested properly._

Check out the `develop` branch and navigate to `hw/picocart64_v1_lite/`. Compress the `gerb_picocart64-lite_v1_2` to a `.zip` file.

Go to [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com) and make an account if you don't have one already. Push the *Order now* button in the top-right.

This takes you to the PCB configuration utility where you can upload the `.zip` file you just created. After uploading, you should see a rendered version of both sides of the PCB. If you want to produce a cheap cart for testing you can leave all settings as they are, except for this one:

:exclamation: *PCB Thickness* needs to be set to *1.0mm*, otherwise the cart won't fit in your console

:exclamation: Note that this will result in a PCB with 90 degrees edges - the edge connector should be sanded down to get a nice 45 degree V shape. If this is not done, it may wear down your cart connector on the N64. The proper PCB order should be ENIG-RoHS + Gold Fingers + 45Â°finger chamfered, however this will result in a significant cost increase.

## Sourcing the components
For building the lite version, you need the following parts along with the PCBs. Here we're assuming you want to assemble 5 boards, as that is the number of PCBs you'll be getting from JLCPCB as a minimum.

For the stamp design, these are needed. This list is not exhaustive, and still a WIP.

## Assembling the board
This is TODO until jchillerup has received his boards and has been able to snap some pictures.
